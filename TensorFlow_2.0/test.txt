i’m a student from india and want to learn data algorithms. i think it will be beneficial 
for me to get into a good firm as an intern. but i’ve no job of my own to carry the expanses
to pay for the certificate of this course. i live only for my scholarship. in this circumstance,
it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. financial
aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs.
so i’m badly in need of this financial aid.receiving this financial aid will open for me a new
horizons of the world of coursera courses , which in turn will help me in future .sir we are
three brothers and we all are at learning stage and it becomes a lot difficult for the family
members to pay the whole amount for all the three of us and if i add up my course it will
make even harder for them to pay. sir, i need this course very badly for my cv and for
increasing my knowledge about the subject

due to my curiosity and also that i can put a good cv to a get applied to a job. this course
will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. it will help perform better in
carrying out various programs in a computer language and give me an edge over my
competitors. a verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate i receive from this
course. i plan to complete all assignments on or before time as i have done in previous
signature track courses. also i intend to participate in discussion forums, which i have
found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses i have taken on
coursera. i also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which i believe will
an invaluable learning opportunity.

sir, the financial status of the family is not too good to pay the loan amount. we already have
a lot of dept in the bank and my parents are paying it on regular basis. it would make their life
even harder to add a new loan over them. sir, i don't want to put any pressure over them. sir, it
would be a great help for me to get a good job and help my family if i'm able to get this course.
